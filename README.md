## What is this repository for? ##

The purpose of this repository is to maintain control over versions of Commitlint. This maintains uniformity when
enforcing coding standards and formatting rules. This allows for easier upgrades and prevents newer versions from
breaking the pipeline.

---

## Configuration information ##

There is a '.commitlint.yaml' file containing the Commitlint configuration in the root of the project directory. You can
use the following YAML line to copy this into your project directory.

```shell
cp /app/.commitlint.yaml $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
```

Alternately you can use the following command to use your own configuration file.

```shell
commitlint -l -c -s -g .commitlint.yaml
```

See links below for more information about Commitlint and Alpine Linux.
